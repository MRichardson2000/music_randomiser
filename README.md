-- album selector --

I had an idea lets see where it goes. I love music but I tend to default to my favourite comfort bands and albums. 

So I thought, lets build a randomiser to pick for me to remove the element of choice. I've exported the xml file from apple music. 

I've never worked with xml's so it's an opportunity to learn about those at the same time 

Lets see what happens :D

-- Well then --

worked out better than expected and loads of room for improvements too!

For now you can either get random artists or albums based on what you pass in. Neat and effective

haha awesome! off for a walk to listen to my first 3 generated albums
mercenary
i hope we make it out of this alive
in medias res.

i'll definitely be improving this!
